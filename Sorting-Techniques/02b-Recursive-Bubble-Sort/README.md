#### **Problem Statement:**

You are given an integer `n` representing the number of elements in an array `arr[]`. Your task is to sort the array using the **Bubble Sort** algorithm.

---

#### **Examples**:

**Example 1:**

Input:  
```
n = 5  
arr[] = {4, 1, 3, 9, 7}
```  
Output:  
```
1 3 4 7 9
```

---

**Example 2:**

Input:  
```
n = 10  
arr[] = {10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1}
```  
Output:  
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

---

#### **Your Task:**

You don't need to read input or print anything. You just need to implement the function `bubblesort(arr[], n)` which takes the array `arr[]` and its size `n` as input and sorts the array using the **Bubble Sort** algorithm.

---

#### **Constraints**:
- \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^3 \)
- \( 1 \leq arr[i] \leq 10^3 \)
