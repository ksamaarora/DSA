#### Problem Statement:
Given a singly linked list, the task is to find the length of the linked list, where the length is defined as the number of nodes in the linked list.

#### Examples:
1. **Input:** `LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5`  
   **Output:** `5`  
   **Explanation:** The count of nodes in the linked list is 5, which is its length.

2. **Input:** `LinkedList: 2->4->6->7->5->1->0`  
   **Output:** `7`  
   **Explanation:** The count of nodes in the linked list is 7. Hence, the output is 7.

#### Expected Time Complexity:
- O(n)

#### Expected Auxiliary Space:
- O(1)

#### Constraints:
- 1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>
- 1 ≤ node->data ≤ 10<sup>3</sup>
