#### Problem Statement:
Given a linked list of `n` nodes and a key, the task is to check if the key is present in the linked list or not.

#### Example:
1. **Input:**  
   - `n = 4`  
   - `Linked List: 1->2->3->4`  
   - `Key = 3`  
   
   **Output:** `True`  
   **Explanation:** `3` is present in the linked list, so the function returns `true`.

#### Your Task:
You need to complete the function `searchKey()`, which takes the head reference of the linked list and a key as input and returns a boolean value (`true` or `false`) indicating whether the key is present in the linked list.

#### Constraints:
- 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>
- 1 ≤ `key` ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>

#### Expected Time Complexity:
- O(n)

#### Expected Space Complexity:
- O(1)
