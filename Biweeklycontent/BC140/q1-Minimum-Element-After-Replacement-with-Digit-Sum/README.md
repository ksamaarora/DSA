### Problem Statement:

You are given a vector `nums` of integers. Your task is to replace each integer in the vector with the sum of its digits. After replacing all the elements, return the minimum value among the updated elements.

### Example 1:
- **Input:** `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
- **Output:** `1`
- **Explanation:** 
  - The sum of digits for each element: `[1, 2, 3, 4]` remains unchanged.
  - The minimum element is `1`.

### Example 2:
- **Input:** `nums = [999, 19, 199]`
- **Output:** `1`
- **Explanation:** 
  - Sum of digits for each element:
    - 999 → 9 + 9 + 9 = 27
    - 19 → 1 + 9 = 10
    - 199 → 1 + 9 + 9 = 19
  - The array becomes `[27, 10, 19]`.
  - The minimum element is `10`.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

**Note:** You need to replace each number in `nums` with the sum of its digits, then return the minimum sum among the replaced numbers.
