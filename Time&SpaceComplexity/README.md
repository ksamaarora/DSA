### Good coding practice:

If a question of adding two numbers like a and b is asked, one of the possible methods will be 

b = a+b. In this case, the space complexity is definitely reduced as we are not using any extra variable but this is not a good practice to manipulate the given inputs or data. In an interview, we must be careful that we will not manipulate the given data even if the space complexity becomes 2N instead of N. If the interviewer specifically instructs us to manipulate, then only we should attempt this method.

> #### Note: A company may use the same data for different purposes. That is why we should not attempt to manipulate the given data for reducing the space complexity. So, we will never manipulate the given data i.e. the inputs until the interviewer specifically says so.
