## 9. Palindrome Number

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Status:** Solved  

---

### Problem Statement

Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise.

A **palindrome** integer is an integer that reads the same backward as forward.

---

### Follow-Up

Can you solve it **without** converting the integer to a string?

---

### Examples

#### Example 1
```
Input:  x = 121  
Output: true  
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```

#### Example 2
```
Input:  x = -121  
Output: false  
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore, it is not a palindrome.
```

#### Example 3
```
Input:  x = 10  
Output: false  
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore, it is not a palindrome.
```
