Here's the code extracted from your image along with an explanation:

### Code:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        stack<TreeNode*> st;
        TreeNode* node = root;
        vector<int> inorder;
        
        while (true) {
            if (node != NULL) {
                st.push(node);
                node = node->left;
            } else {
                if (st.empty() == true) break;
                node = st.top();
                st.pop();
                inorder.push_back(node->val);
                node = node->right;
            }
        }
        
        return inorder;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `stack<TreeNode*> st;`: A stack is used to keep track of nodes, simulating the call stack of a recursive solution.
   - `TreeNode* node = root;`: A pointer `node` is initialized to the root of the tree.
   - `vector<int> inorder;`: This vector will store the result of the inorder traversal.

2. **Main Traversal Loop**:
   - The loop continues indefinitely until all nodes have been processed, but it breaks when both `node` is `nullptr` and the stack is empty.

3. **Traversing the Left Subtree**:
   - `if (node != NULL)`: If `node` is not `nullptr`, it means there are more nodes to visit on the left. 
   - `st.push(node);`: The current node is pushed onto the stack, indicating that it will be processed later.
   - `node = node->left;`: Move to the left child of the current node.

4. **Processing the Node**:
   - `else`: If `node` is `nullptr`, it means the leftmost node has been reached or there are no more left children.
   - `if (st.empty() == true) break;`: If the stack is empty, all nodes have been processed, so the loop breaks.
   - `node = st.top();`: The node on the top of the stack (the last unprocessed node) is retrieved.
   - `st.pop();`: This node is then removed from the stack.
   - `inorder.push_back(node->val);`: The value of this node is added to the `inorder` vector (this is where the node is actually "visited").
   - `node = node->right;`: Now, move to the right subtree.

5. **Returning the Result**:
   - `return inorder;`: Once the loop is done, the `inorder` vector containing the values in the correct inorder sequence is returned.

### How It Works:
- This approach simulates the recursive inorder traversal using a stack. 
- The key idea is to keep going left until you canâ€™t, then process the current node, and finally go right.
- The stack keeps track of where to go back to when you've reached the bottom of the left subtree.

### Example Walkthrough:
Consider a tree like this:
```
    1
     \
      2
     /
    3
```
The inorder traversal would visit nodes in this order: `1, 3, 2`.

**Traversal Process**:
- Start at root `1`.
- Push `1` to stack, move left (but there's no left child).
- Pop `1`, add to result.
- Move to `2`.
- Push `2` to stack, move left to `3`.
- Push `3`, move left (no left child).
- Pop `3`, add to result.
- Move to `2`.
- Pop `2`, add to result.
- No more nodes left, so end traversal.

This code ensures the nodes are visited in the correct inorder sequence.
