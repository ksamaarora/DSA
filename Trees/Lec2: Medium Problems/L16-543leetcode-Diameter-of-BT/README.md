## LeetCode Problem 543: Diameter of Binary Tree

**Difficulty:** Easy

### Problem Statement

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is defined as the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root. The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 
```
root = [1,2,3,4,5]
```
**Output:** 
```
3
```
**Explanation:** The longest path is either `[4,2,1,3]` or `[5,2,1,3]`, with a length of 3 edges.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 
```
root = [1,2]
```
**Output:** 
```
1
```
