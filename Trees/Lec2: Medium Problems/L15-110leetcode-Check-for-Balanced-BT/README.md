### **Problem: Balanced Binary Tree**

**Difficulty:** Easy

**LeetCode Problem #110**

---

**Problem Statement:**

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

A binary tree is considered height-balanced if, for every node in the tree, the difference in height between the left and right subtrees is no more than 1.

---

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: true
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 5000]`.
- `-10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4`
