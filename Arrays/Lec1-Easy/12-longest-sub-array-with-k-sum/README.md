### Longest Sub-Array with Sum K

#### Problem Statement:
Given an array `arr` containing `n` integers and an integer `k`, your task is to find the length of the longest sub-array with the sum of the elements equal to the given value `k`.

#### Examples:

1. **Input**:  
   `n = 6, arr[] = {10, 5, 2, 7, 1, 9}, k = 15`  
   **Output**:  
   `4`  
   **Explanation**:  
   The sub-array is `{5, 2, 7, 1}`.

2. **Input**:  
   `n = 3, arr[] = {-1, 2, 3}, k = 6`  
   **Output**:  
   `0`  
   **Explanation**:  
   There is no such sub-array with sum `6`.

#### Expected Time Complexity:
- `O(n)`

#### Expected Auxiliary Space:
- `O(n)`

---

#### Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `-10^5 <= arr[i], k <= 10^5`
