## 75. Sort Colors
**Difficulty:** Medium

### Problem Statement
Given an array `nums` containing `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, you need to sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent. The colors are represented by the integers `0`, `1`, and `2`, corresponding to red, white, and blue, respectively. 

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

### Example
**Example 1:**
- **Input:** `nums = [2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0]`
- **Output:** `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]`

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** `nums = [2, 0, 1]`
- **Output:** `[0, 1, 2]`

### Constraints
- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 300`
- `nums[i]` is either `0`, `1`, or `2`.

### Follow Up
Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant extra space?
