### Note on Time and Space Complexity Analysis for Digit Counting

#### **Method 1: Using Division**

```cpp
int countDigits(int n){
    int count = 0;
    while(n != 0){
        n = n / 10;
        count++;
    }    
    return count;
}
```

**Explanation**:
- This method counts the number of digits by repeatedly dividing the number \( n \) by 10. Each division removes the last digit, and the process continues until \( n \) becomes 0.
- For each division, we increment a counter, and by the end, the counter will hold the total number of digits in the original number.

**Time Complexity (TC)**:
- Each division reduces \( n \) by a factor of 10. If \( n \) has \( d \) digits, the loop will run \( d \) times.
- The number of digits \( d \) in \( n \) is \( d = \log_{10}(n) \), so the time complexity is:
  \[
  \text{TC} = O(\log_{10}(n))
  \]

**Space Complexity (SC)**:
- The only extra space used is for the counter variable `count`, which is constant regardless of the size of \( n \).
- Therefore, the space complexity is:
  \[
  \text{SC} = O(1)
  \]

#### **Method 2: Using Logarithm**

```cpp
int countDigits(int n){
    int cnt = (int)(log10(n) + 1);
    return cnt;
}
```

### Formula Explanation:

The formula for the number of digits is:
\[
d = \left( \text{int}\left( \log_{10}(n) + 1 \right) \right)
\]
- **\( \log_{10}(n) \)** gives a fractional number where the integer part indicates the most significant digit's position.
- **Adding 1** adjusts for the fact that \( \log_{10}(n) \) only accounts for the exponent, which is one less than the actual number of digits.
- **Casting to an integer** \( \text{int}(x) \) ensures that we get a whole number representing the number of digits.

**Explanation**:
- This method uses the logarithm function \( \log_{10}(n) \) to calculate the number of digits directly.
- \( \log_{10}(n) \) gives the exponent required to express \( n \) in the form \( 10^x \), where \( x \) represents the position of the most significant digit. By adding 1 and casting it to an integer, we get the total number of digits.
- For example, if \( n = 5678 \), \( \log_{10}(5678) \approx 3.753 \), so the number of digits is \( \text{int}(3.753 + 1) = 4 \).

**Time Complexity (TC)**:
- The logarithmic operation \( \log_{10}(n) \) is performed in constant time \( O(1) \), making the time complexity:
  \[
  \text{TC} = O(1)
  \]

**Space Complexity (SC)**:
- Like in Method 1, only a single variable `cnt` is used, so the space complexity remains:
  \[
  \text{SC} = O(1)
  \]

### **Summary Table**:

| **Method**      | **Time Complexity** | **Space Complexity** |
|-----------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Method 1**    | \( O(\log_{10}(n)) \)          | \( O(1) \)                 |
| **Method 2**    | \( O(1) \)           | \( O(1) \)                 |

### Additional Explanation:

- **Method 1** is intuitive and works by manually counting digits through repeated division. However, this requires \( O(\log_{10}(n)) \) time since the number of iterations is proportional to the number of digits in \( n \).
  
- **Method 2** uses the logarithmic function \( \log_{10}(n) \) to compute the number of digits in constant time. This method is faster as it performs the calculation in one step.

Both methods have the same space complexity \( O(1) \), as they use only a small, fixed amount of extra space. However, **Method 2** is more efficient in terms of time complexity because it runs in \( O(1) \) time, regardless of the size of \( n \).
