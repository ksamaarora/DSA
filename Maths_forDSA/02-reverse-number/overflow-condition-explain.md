### Overflow in Integer Reversal
The problem arises when reversing the digits of an integer results in a number that exceeds the range of a 32-bit signed integer. In C++, the range for a signed `int` is from `-2,147,483,648` to `2,147,483,647` (`INT_MIN` to `INT_MAX`). If the reversed number exceeds this range, we must return `0` as per the problem's typical constraints (e.g., on platforms like LeetCode).

### Overflow Check Explained
Before you add the next digit to `reverse_digit`, you need to ensure that multiplying `reverse_digit` by 10 won't cause it to go beyond the allowable range. Here's how that works:

1. **Positive Overflow Check:**

   ```cpp
   if (reverse_digit > INT_MAX / 10 || (reverse_digit == INT_MAX / 10 && lastdigit > 7))
       return 0;
   ```

   - **First part: `reverse_digit > INT_MAX / 10`:**
     - This checks if multiplying `reverse_digit` by 10 would cause it to exceed the maximum allowable value (`2,147,483,647`). If `reverse_digit` is already greater than `214,748,364` (which is `INT_MAX / 10`), multiplying it by 10 would definitely make it overflow.
     
   - **Second part: `(reverse_digit == INT_MAX / 10 && lastdigit > 7)`:**
     - If `reverse_digit` is exactly `214,748,364` (i.e., `INT_MAX / 10`), then the overflow could happen if the next digit (`lastdigit`) is greater than `7`. This is because the maximum value for a 32-bit integer ends with `7` in `2,147,483,647`. So if adding the next digit makes the value exceed `2147483647`, it would overflow.
   
   - **Example:**
     - Suppose `reverse_digit` is `214,748,364`, and the next `lastdigit` is `8`. If you proceed with the calculation, `reverse_digit * 10 + 8 = 2,147,483,648`, which exceeds `INT_MAX`. Hence, we return `0` in this case.

2. **Negative Overflow Check:**

   ```cpp
   if (reverse_digit < INT_MIN / 10 || (reverse_digit == INT_MIN / 10 && lastdigit < -8))
       return 0;
   ```

   - **First part: `reverse_digit < INT_MIN / 10`:**
     - This checks if multiplying `reverse_digit` by 10 would cause it to go below the minimum allowable value (`-2,147,483,648`). If `reverse_digit` is less than `-214,748,364` (which is `INT_MIN / 10`), multiplying by 10 will cause overflow.
     
   - **Second part: `(reverse_digit == INT_MIN / 10 && lastdigit < -8)`:**
     - If `reverse_digit` is exactly `-214,748,364` (i.e., `INT_MIN / 10`), then an overflow might occur if the next digit (`lastdigit`) is less than `-8`. This is because the minimum value for a 32-bit integer ends with `-8` in `-2,147,483,648`. Adding any smaller number will cause the value to go beyond the minimum limit.
   
   - **Example:**
     - Suppose `reverse_digit` is `-214,748,364`, and the next `lastdigit` is `-9`. If you proceed, `reverse_digit * 10 + (-9) = -2,147,483,649`, which is less than `INT_MIN`. Hence, we return `0` in this case.

### Why These Specific Numbers Matter?
- **`INT_MAX = 2,147,483,647`**: The largest value an integer can hold.
- **`INT_MAX / 10 = 214,748,364`**: Multiplying anything larger than this by 10 would result in a number larger than `2,147,483,647`.
- **The last digit `7` of `INT_MAX` is crucial**: If your reversed number is equal to `214,748,364`, adding any digit greater than `7` will overflow.

Similarly, for negative numbers:
- **`INT_MIN = -2,147,483,648`**: The smallest value an integer can hold.
- **`INT_MIN / 10 = -214,748,364`**: Multiplying anything smaller than this by 10 will exceed the minimum limit.
- **The last digit `-8` of `INT_MIN` matters**: If your reversed number is `-214,748,364`, adding any digit smaller than `-8` will overflow.

By incorporating these checks, your code will correctly handle all overflow cases when reversing the integer.
