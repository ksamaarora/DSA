### **Problem: Maximum Depth of Binary Tree**

**Difficulty:** Easy

**LeetCode Problem #104**

---

**Problem Statement:**

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

The maximum depth of a binary tree is defined as the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
```

---

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
